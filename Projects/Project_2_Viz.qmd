# Introduction

In this project you will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a dataset from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. The goal is to explore individual variables and relationships between them. You are free to choose any TidyTuesday dataset that meets the following requirements:

- **At least 5 variables** (columns) that are either numeric or factors.
- **At least 2 numeric variables**.
- **At least 2 factor (categorical) variables**.
- Avoid variables such as names, addresses, or IDs that aren’t suitable for visualization.

A data set may have more than just 5 good plotting variables. You will pick 5 out of all the variables included for the remainder of the tasks. 

*Note: Each TidyTuesday dataset file includes instructions on how to access and understand the data. Please review those instructions carefully.*


# Example TidyTuesday Datasets

Below are five TidyTuesday datasets that meet the above criteria. You do not have to use one of these, but they serve as examples:

1. **Netflix Movies and TV Shows (2021-04-20)**  
   [Dataset Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-04-20)  
   - *Numeric Variables*: `release_year`, `duration`  
   - *Factor Variables*: `type` (Movie/TV Show), `rating`

2. **Coffee Ratings (2020-07-07)**  
   [Dataset Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-07-07)  
   - *Numeric Variables*: `rating`, `aroma`, `flavor` scores  
   - *Factor Variables*: `country`, `variety`

3. **Bird Collisions (2019-04-30)**  
   [Dataset Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-24)  
   - *Numeric Variables*: e.g., `count`  
   - *Factor Variables*: `species`, `location_type`

4. **Tornado Data (2023-05-16)**  
   [Dataset Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-16)  
   - *Numeric Variables*: e.g., `state`, `month`  
   - *Factor Variables*: e.g., `magnitude`, `loss`

5. **Plastic Pollution (2021-01-26)**  
   [Dataset Link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-01-26)  
   - *Numeric Variables*: e.g., `plastic_measurement`  
   - *Factor Variables*: e.g., `region`, `country`

# Getting Started with the Data

Below is an example of how you might load and inspect a TidyTuesday dataset using R. (Be sure to install the required packages if needed.)

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(tidytuesdayR)  # For loading TidyTuesday data
library(dplyr)         # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)       # For plotting

# Replace 'YYYY-MM-DD' with the date of the dataset you want to use.
# Example: To load the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from 2021-04-20:
tues_data <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-04-20')

# View the names of the datasets included in this release
names(tues_data)

# Follow the instructions in the dataset documentation to select the appropriate data frame.
# For example, if the dataset of interest is named 'netflix', you can access it via:
# netflix_data <- tues_data$netflix
```


# Your Analysis Workflow

Perform your EDA by following these steps:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Import the dataset and remove any unnecessary columns (e.g., names, IDs, addresses).
   - Check that your dataset meets the requirements (≥ 5 variables; at least 2 numeric and 2 factors).
   - If more variables are in the data set, choose 5 to use for the remainder of the assignment

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Generate summary statistics and visualizations for each variable.
   - **Bivariate Analysis:** Create visualizations to examine at least one relationship for each of the following pairs of variables (at least 3 plots needed for this section):
     - Two numeric variables
     - Two categorical variables
     - A numeric and a categorical variable
   - **Multi-Variable Visualization:** Create at least two plots that incorporate three or more variables. For instance:
     - Use `facet_wrap()` to create subplots based on a categorical variable.
     - Map a third variable to point size or color in a scatterplot.

3. **Summarizing Findings**
   - Write a summary of what your plots reveal about the relationships between variables.
   - Include insights drawn from both univariate and bivariate explorations.

# Submission Guidelines

- Submit a PDF report generated from this QMD file.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and organized.
- Your final report should include:
  - All code used for analysis.
  - The generated visualizations.
  - A written summary of your findings.
- Collaboration is allowed. You may work individually or in groups.
