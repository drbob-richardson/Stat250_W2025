## Your Turn!

-   Be Authentic

-   Often we collaborate with fields and research questions where we don't have much / any expertise. Be curious. Find and listen to others who have thoughts to share. Use the internet. Connect to what you do know.

-   Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Do something for each question. If you have 15 more minutes, what would make it better?
