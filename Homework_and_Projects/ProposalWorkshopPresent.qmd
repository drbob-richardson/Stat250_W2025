## Announcements

## Details

![](images/projectcycle.png)

-   Project should be an authentic reflection of your skills

## Use of Class Time {.smaller}

### Today: Brainstorm

-   Look at Kaggle, Tidy Tuesday, Sports Viz Sunday, Makeover Monday,
    Viz for Social Good, FiveThirtyEight datasets
    -   not to use, but to get you thinking about your interests

### Monday: Write up

-   Even if you aren't sure about your choice, write a proposal to gain
    confidence in completing the assignment
-   May identify weaknesses that would lead to choosing a different
    project

## Speed Group Interviews {.smaller}

Evaluate yourself

-   Expertise / Curiosity in Application Area

-   Time expecting to spend on project (10 hrs, 25 hrs, until it's done)

-   Procrastinator?

-   Strength / Build Confidence / Avoid

    -   data skills

    -   visualization skills

    -   communication skills

Be Authentic

(Try working on Homework 5 together to explore compatable schedules,
skills, etc.)

## Research Question

-   Define a research question and look for data that would address it

-   Create a dataset and brainstorm research questions

*If you choose to do a project reflecting the broad R universe your
proposal will look different. Please work with the TAs or me to write an
efficient project proposal with appropriate scope of work.*

## Project Work Advice {.smaller}

Often you don't know how "hard" a project is until you get into the
details

-   After brainstorming topics spend the weekend with each individual
    exploring a possible project (data sources, outline what might be
    required to create a tidy dataset)

-   In a "parallel work" group each person may pursue different projects
    with the graded project the best one

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

-   Dream project (possible but amount of time is unknown)

-   Identify a "back-up" project that is well defined and you are highly
    confident in completing

## Proposal Grading Details

`Introduction         10 pts`

`Data Task Difficulty 15 pts`

`Data Analysis Plan    5 pts`

Data Task Difficulty is scored on the complexity and skill required to
perform the work

-   Curated tidy datasets in a .csv file will receive 3-5 pts

-   Examples from the Wrangling section would be scored at 10-15 pts
