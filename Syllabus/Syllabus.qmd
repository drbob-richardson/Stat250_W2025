# Homework {.smaller}

* The course is split into several units, each unit has 
  + Slides for the material
  + A homework set
      - This will be completed, turned in, and graded
      - Part of this will always be done in class together
  + A second set of problems
    - I call these drills because they are extra non-comprehensive practice often focusing on a single concept
    - These are not turned in, but are expected to be understood
    - Solutions to these will be posted as well, but try to answer them and undestand them without the solutions first
  
  
* Homework will be in the form of quarto files you will need to fill in  



# Import technologies and tools

- **RStudio**: An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment that helps to organize a coding environment
- **R**: Is a programming software that is especially tuned to data analysis problems

# Policies

## Honor Code

Students are expected to maintain academic honesty and adhere to BYU's Dress and Grooming Standards.  
Violations may result in disciplinary action.

## AI

I am in the camp of professors who think AI is amazing and we should be using it. This class is a great place for you to understand the limits of an AI tool, like ChatGPT in helping you code. For example, debugging with ChatGPT is much easier than before. To get the most out of this class, I would ask that you try to code first before turning to ChatGPT.
