# Course Description

Introduce programming concepts essential for success as a statistician. These include

-   Basic to Advanced Programming Knowledge
-   Data Wrangling and Visualization
-   Simulation, sampling, and testing

# Course Materials

**Texts**:\
- *R For Data Science*, 2nd Edition <https://r4ds.hadley.nz> - *Hands on Programming in R*, 4th Edition <https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/>

**Course Management**: Learning Suite\
**Materials**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/drbob-richardson/Stat250_W2025.git)

# Grade Distribution

-   Homework: 40%\
-   Projects: 25%\
-   Midterm Exam: 15%
-   Final Exam: 20%

## Exams

Both the **midterm** and the **final exam** will have two parts:

1.  **Part I (In-Class, AI-Free)**
    -   Taken in class under standard exam conditions.\
    -   No AI tools may be used.
    -   Anything in your Stat 250 Project directory can be used, including course material and any notes you have made
2.  **Part II (Take-Home, AI-Allowed)**
    -   After completing Part I, you will receive the same exam to redo at home.\
    -   You may use your notes, AI tools, Google, or other resources to check and improve your work.\
    -   The goal is for you to reflect on and learn from your initial attempt.

### Schedule

-   **Midterm**: TBD (will be held around the first or second week of October).\
-   **Final Exam**: Friday, December 13 at 11:00 AM (Part I in class, Part II as a take-home).

# Homework {.smaller}

-   The course is split into several units, each unit has
    -   Slides for the material
    -   A homework set
        -   This will be completed, turned in, and graded
        -   Part of this will always be done in class together
    -   A second set of problems
        -   I call these drills because they are extra non-comprehensive practice often focusing on a single concept
        -   These are not turned in, but are expected to be understood
        -   Solutions to these will be posted as well, but try to answer them and undestand them without the solutions first
-   Homework will be in the form of quarto files you will need to fill in

# Import technologies and tools

-   **RStudio**: An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment that helps to organize a coding environment
-   **R**: Is a programming software that is especially tuned to data analysis problems

# Praying in Class

I have an opt-in prayer schedule. Sign up for days here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w7S-xuLLaKEXfCRjYYCHJgcB2KtbtwevKuAwSWWIoYM/edit?usp=sharing>

# Discord

Discord is a handy tool for asking quick simple questions. Both the TA and myself or other students can help out when you are stuck. This link should be good through Jan 15, after which you can message me to join the class discord.

# Policies

## Honor Code

Students are expected to maintain academic honesty and adhere to BYU's Dress and Grooming Standards.\
Violations may result in disciplinary action.

## AI

I am in the camp of professors who think AI is amazing and we should be using it. This class is a great place for you to understand the limits of an AI tool, like ChatGPT, in helping you code. For example, debugging with ChatGPT is much easier than before. We will do a significant amount of coding in class, often in settings where you can work with other people. I would ask the following:

### In Class

1.  First, look at the course material and notes.
2.  If you’re stuck, ask a neighbor, TA, or the instructor.
3.  Only after those steps, feel free to use AI or Google.
    -   Use these tools not to get “the answer” directly, but to learn *how* you would solve the problem.

### At Home

1.  First, look at the course notes and materials.
2.  If you’re still stuck, you may:
    -   Ask Google or an AI tool, **or**\
    -   Ask a question on Discord.\
        Both options are fine.

### Exams

-   The **midterm** and **final** each have two parts:
    1.  **Part I**: Taken in class, **AI-free**.\
    2.  **Part II**: A take-home re-take where you redo Part I and may use AI or other resources to check and improve your work.
